# SuttonBartoRL.jl

My [julia-lang](http://julialang.org) experiments while following Sutton and Barto's Reinforcement Learning book.

By the way, [HTML version](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/ebook/the-book.html) is freely availabe
and an [incomplete draft of the second edition](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b3psxv2r0ccmf80/book2015oct.pdf?dl=0) is too!
(Yes, this is all legal, from [the author's own page](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/the-book.html).)

Take a look at the subdirectories, they have their own READMEs with plots!

As long as I'm reading the book and figuring things out, this whole repo is, of course, highly in flux!
I'll be following [the rule of three](http://blog.codinghorror.com/rule-of-three/), meaning I'll only abstract things away if they are needed in at least three of the examples!
